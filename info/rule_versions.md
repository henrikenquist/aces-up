# Aces Up - Rule versioning

## Want more rules in your life?

Implement one marked by \* below using the existing code in `strategy.py`. That's easy.

... or be creative and invent one of your own!

Regarding the naming convention: Yes, it's not perfect - but it works!

## An alternative

An idea I had, tried, and abandoned since I had to make the fundamentals work first.

-> Name rules according to the chaining concept "card-pile-suit":

An example (might be messed up due to editing above, but you get the idea)
"move the highest possible card from one of the smallest piles" = 220
"move an ace if it has a card of same suit below" = 101
"move random card" = 400
"move card from one of the smallest piles if it has a card of same suit below" = 021

first digit:	card type		0 (not specified), 1 (ace), 2 (highest), 3 (lowest), 4 (random)
second digit:	pile type		0 (not specified), 1 (largest), 2 (smallest), 3 (max card sum), 4 (random)
third digit:	suit below		0 (not specified), 1 (suit below)

It is then possible to tag new concepts x and y to the end of the rule code: 203xy

How to present this to the user? A complete table? Messy!
